	<h1>The Why of JavaScript</h1>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>Before and during the early 1990's, a new technology was on the rise. Servers were popping up supplying
	documents consumed by a new type of application on computers. The application was called a 'Web Browser' and the documents 
	were written in a language called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). This was revolutionary...but there 
	was a problem. No matter how nice you made the HTML 'pages', they were static. They were useful for displaying
	information like the contents of books and advertising, but not usable for much more.
       	A way was needed to make the pages dynamic.</p>

	<p>
	In 1995, Netscape Communications, the first company to produce a marketed web browser, created Mocha, the forerunner
	to what most people know today as JavaScript, to help solve this problem. Today, if you are creating a website, you use
	JavaScript. It is now common to write both the code for the server producing the HMTL for the web browser 
	as well as code that lets the web browser be active and adapt to the data it recieves in JavaScript.
	</p>
	<h3>Python and JavaScript are Cousins</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestery of both JavaScript and Python. Since C is an ancestor of both languages
       	you can expect to see some
	things in Javacript that remind you of what you learned about coding in Python. C is not Python's only ancester. A very strong contributor to Python 
	is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula">Modula language</a>. Because of this ancestry, modules exist in Python even though the are
	absent from JavaScript. Since Modulo's ranges are such powerful things, you can find JavaScript libraries you can 
	use in your apps that add in those types of behaviors.

<h1>Installations</h1>
	<h2>The Compiler</h2>

	<h3>Windows</h3>
	<p>If it isn't already installed on your machine, start by installing <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">minGW</a>. Select the link, then watch 
		and follow <a href="https://youtu.be/sXW2VLrQ3Bs">this video</a>. The minGW link in the previous sentence takes 
		you to the safe minGW download site. The video shows you an initial mingw.org page. Ignore that one. The second page
		the video shows you is the same as the one for this <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">minGW download</a>
		link.</p>
		<p>Follow the instructions in the video.</p>

	<h3>MacOS</h3>
		<p>If it isn't already installed on your machine, start by installing the <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew package manager</a>. You can follow 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-SDrN4G4lE">this 
		video tutorial</a> if you would like or follow the instructions on the <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew package manager</a> page.</p>
		<p>Once you have installed Homebrew, use it to install gcc. To do so, enter this code into the terminal;</p>
		<h4>brew install gcc</h4>
		<p>If you previously installed gcc using brew, enter this code into the terminal;</p>
		<h4>brew update gcc</h4>

	<h3>Linux</h3>
		<p>Since various flavors of Linux can use different package managers, in your web browser, do a search that includes the name of your 
		Linux distribution followed by gcc, and install. Follow the instructions you find.</p>
	<h2>Your IDE</h2>
	<p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you use in this class is <a href="https://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>. 
	Download the 64 bit version from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org">this site</a>. This may require clicking a few buttons. The result is
	that you have downloaded the Eclipse IDE installer. Run the installer. Regardless of the platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) you will see this 
	window;</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse_c_installer.png"/>
	<p>When you select <span>Eclipse IDE for C\C++ Developers</span> you will be lead through a complete installation. Use all the default values 
	the installer suggests. Pay particular attention to and remember where Eclipse is being installed.</p>
	<p>Run Eclipse. You will see this dialog;</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse_workspace.png"/>
	<p>Remember but don't change the location of the workspace. This is where all your code will be when you create files using Eclipse.</p>
	<p>If you are running MacOS, you will need to follow <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/mac-gdb-install.html">
	these instructions</a> before your debugger will work.</p>

<h1>Your First Project</h1>

	<p>In the next window you are shown, select <span>Create a new C/C++ project</span>. Up will pop a new set of options for which kind of C 
		application you want to create. For this class, select the <span>Makefile Project</span> type and then you will see this;</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse_project_name_type.png"/>
	<p>In this dialog, give your project a name...hello_world would be great...and click <span>Finish</span> At this point, you're almost ready.
	You should see this on your screen.</p>
	<img src="images/default_main.png">
	<p>Copy the code below and use it to replace the code in hello_world.cpp.</p> 

<pre>
	<code id="junk__c">
	</code>
</pre><p>Now your screen should look like this (without the big, blue, arrow).</p>
	<img src="images/full_main.png">
	<p>If you click the icon pointed to by the big, blue, arrow, your project will build and run and you will see <span>!!!Hello other lldb!!!</span>
	in the <span>Console</span> tab at the bottom of the window.</p>
	<p>Congratulations!! You have your system set up and tested!!!</p>
