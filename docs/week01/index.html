	<h1>The Why of JavaScript</h1>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>Before and during the early 1990's, a new technology was on the rise. Servers were popping up supplying
	documents consumed by a new type of computer application... the 'Web Browser.' The documents 
	were written in a new language called Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) and the protocol used to transfer 
	the data in the document to the web browser was called http. This combination of server, document type, 
	and protocol was revolutionary,but there 
	was a problem. No matter how nice you made the HTML 'pages', they were static. They were useful for displaying
	information like the contents of books and advertising, but not usable for much more.
       	A way was needed to make the pages dynamic.</p>

	<p>
	In 1995, Netscape Communications, the first company to produce a marketed web browser, created  
       	 the forerunner to what most people know today as JavaScript to help solve this problem. They initially called it Mocha. 
	Today, if you are creating a website, you use JavaScript, the name most people use instead of the languages' 
        acutal name, ECMA Script. It is now common to write both the server code  
	producing the HMTL for the web browser as well as code that lets the web browser be active in JavaScript.
	</p>
	<h3>Python and JavaScript are Cousins</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestery of both JavaScript and Python. Since C is an ancestor of both languages
       	you can expect to see some
	things in Javacript that remind you of what you learned about coding in Python. C is not Python's only ancester. 
	A very strong contributor to Python is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula">Modula language</a>. 
	Because of this ancestry, modules exist in Python but not in JavaScript.
	Modulo's ranges are an important part of Python. Other language users see that power and want it too. Because of 
	this, you can find JavaScript libraries to use in your apps that add in Modules, ranges, and other types of behaviors.
