    <p>Controlling Your Code</p>
  </div>
</div>
	<h1>Choice Making and Computational Flow</h1>
	<p>C and Python share a set of structures used to control which part of your code is executed, based on specific situations.
	The idea of situational 'computational flow' control isn't unique to Python or C. It is found in all languages though the 
        way it is accomplished can be different.</p>
	<h3>Logic Used in Computing</h3>
	<p>Boolean logic is used in most languages. In boolean logic, the result of a claim is either true or false, there are no 
	maybe's or kinda's. Something is either true or it is false. This bipartate truth concept isn't the only one, databases 
	use a tripartate concept of truth, but its simplicity is embraced in most programming languages.</p>
	<p>C, like Python, uses a set of operators to check for truth...</p>
	<h3>Switch and If</h3>

	<h3>Getting Loopy</h3>
	<p>Unlike Python, C has no list. Therefore there are no filter or reduce functions or methods. You can find these in non-
	standard libraries, or you could write your own versions of filter and reduce. In C, we use raw loops, not map, filter, or 
	reduce.</p>
	<h4>While</h4>
	<p>C's while loop works with a single boolean logic check. As long as the logic check result is true, the loop continues looping.</p>
	<h4>For</h4>
	<p>Since C has not lists, it also has no version of Python's for-in loop. Instead, C has a for loop you use to accomplish the 
        sam thing. C's for loop has multiple components.</p>
