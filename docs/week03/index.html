	<h1>Organization and Access</h1>
	<p>All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and thinking. In this, they are very
	similar to spoken languages. Each spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
	differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example.
	German, a language closely related to English, organizes things differently. Sometimes German sentences have a
        Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb structure...
	Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish has adjectives 
	after the nouns they modify.</p>
	<p>While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the same thing. They allow us to organize and express
	our thinking.</p>
	<h3>Functions - a fundamental organization concept of JavaScript</h3>
	<p>Python and JavaScript, being related languages, both have functions as a fundimental organizational structure. When you truly begin 
	thinking in JavaScript, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how functions are related to each other. You will 
	have thoughts along these lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this since you will eventually
	realize that when you are designing solutions in JavaScript, how a function accomplishes something is not as important as that it will, 
	and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the function later.</p>
	
	<p>Put an example here of desinging a solution thinking in functions.</p>
	<p>In Python and JavaScript there are similarities and differences between the languages regarding how you declare 
	functions. In JavaScript, the 'function' keyword is used instead of 'def'. Also, JavaScript the convention usually used for names 
	of functions and variables is called 'camel case'. To create a name, the first word of the name starts with a lower-case letter, and the first letter 
	of all the rest of the words making up the name begin with an upper-case letter. For example, a function that averages two numbers 
	could be defined like this.

	<p>JavaScript example

	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">function averageTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum){
	return (firstNum+secondNum)/2
}</code>
	</pre>
</p> 
	Notice the '{' and '}' operators. These are the JavaScript scope operators. These are used instead of the white-space 
	scope operator used in Python. In JavaScript, white space means nothing but when writing your code, it is important to use 
	white space to help make your code easier to read. Never left justify your code. 
	<p>
		As with Python, JavaScript functions can have more than one line of code. The previous example could be written as
<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">function averageTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}</code>
	</pre>
It does exactly the same thing, it's just broken up into multiple lines of code.
	</p>

	<h3>Libraries - sharing your functions with others</h3>
	<p> A higher order organizational idea in JavaScript is library. Libraries are a way that you can share your code for other programmers 
	to use in their applications, and you can share your code with them. Libraries are groups of functions that, unlike 
	applications, can not run on their own. Instead, you use what other people have written and compiled as if you wrote it yourself.</p>

	<p>In JavaScript, libraries consist of some number of files in which you put your JavaScript. By tradition, the names of your files
		always ends in '.js'. If I had a JavaScript library called totally_awsome, and in it there was some code that moved stuff around 
		on the screen, I might put that code in a file called 'animations.js'. There would be other files in my library that contained other functions 
		doing other things. Each file would be named after what it does and use the '.js' name ending. For example, fades.js, slideshow.js, etc.
	</p>

	<h3>Map, Filter, and Reduce</h3>
	<p>In JavaScript, as in most languages, it is important not to write code that duplicates fundamental parts of the standard language library. 
	Therefore, while it would be possible to write a loop in JavaScript to average, modify, or select some elements of an array, you should not. 
	Instead you should use the built-in filter (select some), reduce (average, sum, product, etc.), or map (convert all) functionallity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider a situation where you have been hired to write code for a social media site. 
		You have been asked to write code to count up the total number of 'likes' postings from a single customer has recieved. 
	Existing code that others have written puts a likes count for each posting in an array called 'likes' for you.</p>
	<p>
		Suppose you were told to filter out all the likes counts that are less then 10. How should this be done?</p>
		<p>Like this.</p> 

	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let filteredLikes = likes.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10)
}</code>
	</pre>
	<p>Let's break this up so you can see how it is done. The filter function has one parameter, a function similar to the Lambda function 
		you learned about in Python. That function has one paramter, an element of the array. This parameter, aCount, is seperated by the '=>' operator 
		from the next bit of code describing the filtering to be done. In this case, comparing the aCount parameter to 10.
	</p>

	<p>On the other hand, maybe you have been asked to give the customer five 'bonus likes' that are to be added to each posting.</p>

	<p>How should the likes array be modified?</p>
	<p>
		Like this.
	</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likes = likes.map(aCount => aCount += 5)
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Maybe you are asked to total the customers likes. How should you do that?
	</p>
	<p>
		You would use the reduce function. It has two parameters, the first is a function with two paramters and the second is usually called an accumulator initial value. The accumulator's 
		initial value is used, modified, and returned to accumulates the final result. In this case the the final result is the summation of the likes.
	</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let totalLikes = likes.reduce((accumulator, aCount) => accumulator += aCount,0)
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		What if you are to give five bonus likes only for those that already have 10 likes and then sum the result? 
		You could do a seperate line of code to accomplish this, or since the map and filter array functions return an array,
		you could do it more professionally like this. It uses map, filter, and reduce.
	</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let sum = likes.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10).map(aCount=>aCount += 5).reduce((accumulator, aCount) => accumulator += aCount,0)
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Maybe, in a different part of the application, you are asked to print each of the like values to the console. How should this be done? 
	</p>
	<p>Use the forEach function.</p>

	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likes.forEach(aCount => console.log(aCount))
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Let's imagine that instead of being asked to sum the 
		filtered likes with their bonus, you were asked to print them all out. How could you do this?
	</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likes.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10).map(aCount=>{
		aCount += 5
		console.log(aCount)
		return aCount
		})
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Notice the use of the JavaScript scope operators and the inclusion of the return keyword in the last line of the function 
		passed to map.
