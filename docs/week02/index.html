	<h1>Similarities and Differences</h1>
	<h3>Shared Operators</h3>
	<p>Remember, both Python and JavaScript have C as one of thier ancestors. Because of this, it is not shocking 
	to find out that they share many of the same
		operators as C. These include +, -, /, *, ==, !=, &lt, &gt, etc. By going to these two sites, you can compare 
		<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm">Python's list of operators</a> to 
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp">JavaScript's list of operators</a>. When you do so, 
		you will find that Python has a few that JavaScript does not. You will also see that the conditional operators, 
		also known as logical operators, exist in both languages but use different characters.</p>
	<h3>JavaScript's missing operators</h3>
	<p>Because Python are different languages and the creators of JavaScript had different opinions than those who 
	created Python, there are some Python operators you should not expect to find in C. They are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>** - the exponentiation operator</li>
		<li>// - the floor division operator</li>
		<li>&lt&gt - an alternative to !=</li>
		<li>**= - the exponent and assign operator</li>
		<li>and - the logical and operator</li>
		<li>or - the locical or operator</li>
		<li>not - the logical not operator</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't get the wrong idea. Each of these behaviors can be done in JavaScript, they will just be done a little differently. Take a look
	at Table 1 to see how.</p>

	<h3>Variables</h3>
	<p>In Python, a variable can hold any type of value and can change the type of value it holds. For example, this code is valid in Python.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="Python">age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2
age = 'old'</code>
	</pre>
	<p>JavaScript variables behave in much the same way. They can hold any type and the type can change, just like in Python. JavaScript does require you to use the let keyword to declare a variable like this:</p>
	<pre>
<code>let age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2
age = 'old'</code>
	</pre>
	<h3>Constants</h3>
	<p>In Python, Constants are declared using an all upper case name</p>
	
	<pre>
<code class="Python">PI=3.14</code
	</pre>
	<p>In JavaScript this is done differently, instead of using all upper case names, JavaScript requires the use of the 
	const keyword, like this:</p>
	<pre>
<code>const PI = 3.14</code>
	</pre>
	<p>While it is not required that the names of your constantes be all upper case, it is considered good form.</p>
	<p>As with all things, there are pluses and minuses of requiring keywords like const and let. One disadvantage is 
	the extra cluttering of the code with 'unnecessary' words. An advantage is explicitness. Everyone that later reads 
	your code will know exactly what you meant to have happen. Also, because of this explicitness, a variable can't be 
	accidentally declared twice in JavaScript, a situation which can happen in large Python code sets.
